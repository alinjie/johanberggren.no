Saw a couple on my way home making out in the park  
Funny how needy you get out here in the dark  
Heard a girl outside the Deli crying on the phone  
She reminded me of you wanting someone to be dead and gone

There’s still an hour left before the bars begins to close  
So gimme someone to talk to and something for my throat  
I ain’t tired yet and darling I can go all night  
Don’t you walk away and leave me here with the flickering lights

Cause then I'll go back home again  
Back to being alone again  
Back to an empty room with filled with things I hate  
‘cause they make me think of you

We used to laugh and smoke our troubles away  
Talking to them one on one only makes them stay  
Are you asleep tonight would you answer if I called?  
You know as well as I what we had won’t grow cold

But I’ll go back home again  
Back to being alone again  
Back to the empty room with filled with things I hate  
‘cause they make me think of you

When my 406 breaks down I’ll find me something else  
I ain’t got a minute to spare for things you easily replace  
But nobody’s like you and believe me when I say  
No matter where you go and what you do I’ll love you till my dying day  
No matter where you go and what you do I’ll love you till my dying day

And then I’ll go back home again  
Back to being alone again  
Back to an empty room filled with things I hate  
‘cause they make me think of you
