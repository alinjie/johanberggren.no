Back when I met you there was something in your eyes  
Seems like it disappeared through the years  
That on guy at the party everybody recognized  
is now not even here

Why don’t you call me up and tell me what is wrong  
Why don’t you call me up and tell me what is wrong

We’ve all got our ups and downs and I guess you’ve got yours  
Things don’t always end up as we’ve planned  
And I know it can feel like nobody’s around  
Let me help you leave it in the past

Please just call me up, and tell me what is wrong  
Please just call me up, and tell me what is wrong  
Where’s that guy I used to know

There is something so unfamiliar about the way you smile  
Are you broken on the inside do you cry?  
Suddenly you’re lying there all dressed up in white  
Do you want to die asking yourself why  
Do you really want to die asking yourself why

Don’t you call me up and tell me what is wrong  
Why don’t you call me up and tell me what is wrong  
Like I used to do  
‘cause I used to call you
