All I can hear is the wind that cries  
as it helps thee snow climb on the walls outside  
I haven’t spoken to anyone in a week  
I miss you a little bit but I don’t lose sleep

Tomorrow will be like yesterday  
What if I’m one of those who like it that way  
At least when life is out to kill  
It’s nice being a place where time stands still

If I could disappear I would  
Maybe you could come too  
I’ve heard nice things about Spain I think I’d like it there  
But for now I’m good right here

I’ve been thinking about moving to the countryside  
To get somewhere to scream to get somewhere to hide  
Away from all the people that have grown so cold  
They can’t blame it on the winter anymore

If I could disappear I would  
Maybe you could come too  
I’ve heard nice things about Spain I think I’d like it there  
But for now I’m good right here

Some days I wish that I’ll get snowed in  
I got enough canned food to make it until spring  
I could tell my friends that I’ve moved to Spain  
Then change my number and change my name

And suddenly I’ve disappeared  
All that’s missing now is you  
I’ll let you know where I’m if still you care  
But for now, I’m good right here  
For now I’m good right here
