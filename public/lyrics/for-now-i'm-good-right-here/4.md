I am not a man yet  
And I don’t think I’ll ever be  
But I know what I want  
Come sleep next to me  
I didn’t mean to hurt you  
Baby why would I  
Blow up everything that I’ve  
Ever wanted in this life

Don’t believe everything you hear  
Round here they lie for the fun  
And I’m tired of running  
Keeping one hand one the gun  
This city life is dangerous  
It’ll eat you up alive  
I wish somebody had warned me  
I’m just a boy from the countryside

Tonight we’ll leave for the border  
I see no reason to return  
And bring that bottle of Gordon's  
Just in case tomorrow burns  
Just in case tomorrow burns
