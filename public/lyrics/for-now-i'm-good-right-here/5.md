I was lost in my dreams like a fish in the sea  
Out looking for someplace else he'd rather be  
A long way from home, and everything I knew  
I was only on the ground whenever I flew  
I had no money I had no friends  
Everything I had was in my head

In my head  
In my head  
In my head

I couldn’t care less about what makes a man a man  
But everybody needs someone who understands  
What’s going on inside your crazy brain  
The hate the love the anger and the pain  
I spent a week just talking to the dead  
‘Cause everything I had was in my head

In my head  
In my head  
In my head

Where’s the one who turned it all into smoke  
And laughed while she took off her clothes like life was a joke  
I was riding shotgun we were flying through the states  
In your ’97 Honda with those rusty Baltimore plates  
I told you the three words I never said  
Then I woke up on the couch it was all in my head

In my head  
In my head  
In my head
