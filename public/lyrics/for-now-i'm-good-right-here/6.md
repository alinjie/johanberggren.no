Billy was an only child the son of a hard working man  
His mother passed while Billy still could fit in her hands  
He was raised in a backwards small town with only a couple hundred people a round  
In a town like that it ain’t easy being the one sticking out

His dad always said to Billy if you work hard you’ll get paid  
And if you don’t you’ll end up like those bums who sleep down by the rails  
So he found himself a good job loading timber at the mill  
Come Friday and the boys would go out to get their fill

The girls there loved Billy they thought he was sweet  
Always quiet in the corner with his two left feet  
And his dad would say Billy now you’re acting strange, come out here and dance  
You’ll never find a woman if you don’t give them a chance

But Billy had a secret at night when his father slept  
He’d climb up to the attic where he kept a champagne dress  
He got it from his grandma she was the only one  
Who truly loved Billy for who he really was

The rain fell ten times harder after his grandma died  
And one morning he couldn’t take it anymore, living a lie  
They found him in the morning with a note in his hand  
Saying daddy I love you but you’ll never understand

Billy’s father had to sell the house it was too big for only one  
And while cleaning out the attic he finally met his son  
He put the dress on Billy’s tombstone and folded it real nice  
And shed some tears for the ones he’d lost as he looked up to the sky
