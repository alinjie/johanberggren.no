Dropped her off at the station I think she headed south  
Names were yelled and I recall her crying when I threw her CDs out  
Drove home in an anger I’ve never felt before  
With lack of sleep and eyes running like a waterfall I could barely see the road

They say it takes more to forgive than to forget  
I say they haven’t yet tried forgetting you  
But I won’t take your sorry for an answer  
Cause I know I can do better than what is left

A couple of years went and I found myself in a junkyard parking lot  
Bearded mechanic asks politely if there is anything left inside  
I see some cigarette butts on the floor as I dismantle the stereo  
Then out falls this record that I know she used to love

They say it takes more to forgive than to forget  
I say they haven’t yet tried forgetting you  
But I won’t take your sorry for an answer  
Cause I know I can do better than what is left

Have you felt how easy loneliness lets the paranoia in?  
And leaves you further away from dry land than you’ve ever been  
I’ve heard behind every man stands a good woman so I turn around  
Yet nothing but the shore is what catches my eye as I’m sinking down

They say it takes more to forgive than to forget  
I say they haven’t yet tried forgetting you  
But I won’t take your sorry for an answer  
Cause I know I can do better than what is left  
Cause I know I can do so much better than what is left
