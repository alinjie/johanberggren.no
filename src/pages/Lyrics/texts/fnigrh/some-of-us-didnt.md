I was born in a small town  
Not knowing many of my age  
But we grew up to live our own lives  
When we grew up I knew we couldn’t stay  

Some of us didn’t  
Some of us did  
Some of us didn’t   
Some of us did  

Left my home to find my own way  
At least a way I could split in half  
Split with you or somebody different  
To be honest with you I didn’t give a damn  

Some of us didn’t  
Some of us did  
Some of us didn’t   
Some of us did  

And on the corner next to Timmy’s  
A friend keeps on sweeping the floors  
He’s been doing it forever  
At least since we turned twelve or some  

But he still breaths   
He still breaths  

Some of us don’t  
Some of us do  
Some of us don’t  
Some of us do  
Some of us don’t  
Some of us do  
Some of us don’t  
Some of us do
